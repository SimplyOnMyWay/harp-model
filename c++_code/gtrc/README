MOC 01.08.2022:
SimpString.cpp modified from that provided in STK overlay:
https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp05/Customizing_STK_Development.html



Original README:

This is a simplified version of a classical guitar for Music 420 lab use.

Simplifications:
----------------
1. Vibrations in only one plane instead of two.
2. No coupling feedback among the strings.
3. Some optimizations taken out.
4. Body resonator filter removed.
5. Comb-filter delay line changed to NON-interpolating.
6. Score file support removed.

Note that pluckPos is approximate because the loopFilter adds delay to
the loop that is not taken into account.  The Biquad object in STK
could be enhanced to return its delay at the fundamental frequency,
and that can be used to refine the delay calculation for pluckPos.
